## Build your Own Portfolio

# Description

This project is to put to the test learnings around CSS Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries and previous basic CSS/html code.

The Portfolio is a starting point for advertising myself and my web developer skills to perspective clients, companies and comunities.

I have managed to use both FlexBox and CSS grid to order my work in a more unique structure with Media queries onces the workding or images become too squashed.

I have added in page and external navigations.  I have also added a photo of me and a box to add a contact detail although there is no onward functionality to that yet.

I have found commenting in CSS very useful and am learning how to do this as i go.

I need to work out how to fix a couple of my items further but as we move through the course i can polish this project.
